# Elm Slack Community Code of Conduct

As a participant of this community, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
participate through the Slack chat and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Administrators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments and other assets that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, 
or to ban temporarily or permanently any participant for other behaviors that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, community administrators commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this community. Community administrators who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the community team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the community or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting a community maintainer at s@porto5.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Administrators are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
